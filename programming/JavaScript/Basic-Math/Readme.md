## Basic Math Operation

Learning to build basic mathmatical function in JavaScript.

In this lesson you will learn how to build and user basic mathmatical function in JavaScript.

### Order of Operation
Just like in general math we use the order of operation to determine the order in which math is completed.

#### Parentheses, Plus, Minus, Multiplication, Division
Our very basic [order of operations]() follows the pattern of parentheses, plus, minus, multiplication, and division.

When we see `(1 + 1) * 1` in math, this tells us that we need to add the 2 one's together, and then multiple it by 1. For the [computer interpreter]() the parenthese tell the interpreter that it needs to break this line down and preform the operation in multiple steps. The first step is to add the 1 + 1, and the second step is to multply the result by 1. 

In many computer language parentheses are used to create the order of operations a separte mathmatical operation for a [squence of code](). You can say that this is a way of creating a [scope]() around some logic.
